# DTR - Derek, Ross, Michelle, Mariana

### Project: Monster Shop


#### Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):

Pass project. We all get the learning goals of the project down. If we have time, get to extensions. Great group experience. Good, open, honest communication.


#### Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):

Ross - Knows material well. Works well alone but always open to jump on a call for driver-navigator. Likes to be ahead of schedule

Michelle - Good mediator for group, communicates well. Ok with material, but will ask if needs help.

Mariana - Always open to ideas and if things could be improved. Knows material well, has done this project before.

Derek - Knows material well, likes to communicate early and often. Wants to be ahead of schedule


#### How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:

If someone gets stuck on something, let's jump on a call and figure it out. Even if there are different ability levels, let's make sure everyone gets the learning out of this project. If we have group conflict, let's communicate issues to try and get over them.


#### Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):

Ross - Run around 4:30-5PM. Bed before 10PM.

Michelle - Walk in the afternoon around an 1hr - 1hr 30 mins. Would prefer to meet in evening. Weekends, noon to 3PM to herself

Mariana - Likes to take lunch hour to herself. After class 30 minute walk. Prefers to cut off work at 7:30PM. Prefers evenings to herself on weekends

Derek - Pretty open. If I schedule something, will communicate to everyone. Weekends, may take a couple hours during day but otherwise able to work

Morning meetup most likely not a thing


#### Communication Expectations (How and how often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):

Daily standups to discuss status around 7PM. Project slack channel. 

Pull requests: Everyone tries to comment. Should have 2 approvals at minimum. Give about a 20-30 minute window after opening for everyone to approve.


#### Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):

We would like to use resources for routing. Improving on activerecord. User authorization and authentication. Factory bots. 

Styling - Focus on BE, if we have time for styling we will get to it.


#### Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):

Each of us would like some activerecord challenges, maybe not Ross.

Derek - Has done favorites/cart. Would be ok with someone else doing

We'll have to have a longer discussion about this after looking at all user stories.


#### Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):

Branches should not go over 3 user stories. Will look into using a CI for managing our pushes to heroku. Will collaborate on github pull requests and merges.


#### Pomodoro Break Schedule:

On your own terms. If on a group call, speak up about poms. No problems taking them.


#### Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:

Positive intent.

Derek is open to negative feedback. 

Michelle likes her feedback blunt/honest/to the point.

Ross likes his feedback sugarcoated.

Mariana open to negative feedback. But don't be rude.


#### Additional Remote Considerations:

Will look into Tuple for video conferencing. Planning meetings in advance as much as possible.


#### Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):

Github projects - Create a card for each user story.


#### Day 1 Agenda:

Heroku
Github projects
Brainstorm project
